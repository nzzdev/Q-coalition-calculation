## Functionality

If a tool then it can use this reference to the Q-server documentation about Q-tools:

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).

Q Coalition Calculation uses the [svelte framework](https://svelte.technology/guide) to render the markup on server-side.
